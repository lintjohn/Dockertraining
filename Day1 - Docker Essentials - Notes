Customize your Image
====================

root@zameer# docker pull ubuntu
root@zameer# docker run -it ubuntu

## ubuntu is running now, you are inside the ubuntu and the name will be changed dynamic one like "root@asdfjalkjso:/#"

root@asdfjalkjso:/# apt-get update
root@asdfjalkjso:/# apt-get install wget
root@asdfjalkjso:/# apt-get install nodejs
root@asdfjalkjso:/# apt-get install npm
## we have installed wget, nodejs and npm on top of base ubuntu

root@asdfjalkjso:/# exit

## now you are back to your server/VM
root@zameer# docker ps -a
## you can see your docker history up/exist
root@zameer# docker images
## you can see the image which you installed additional packages ex: ubuntu

root@zameer# docker commit ubuntu cutom-ubuntu
## here ubuntu is base name which we see in images, now we are committed to cutom-ubuntu name

root@zameer# docker images
root@zameer# docker run -it custom-ubuntu
## this ran, we are inside custome-ubuntu 
## we are trying to check is nodejs is available or not, as we was installed
root@asdfasdfaf:/# which nodejs
/usr/bin/nodejs
## if you see this path, then you are good
